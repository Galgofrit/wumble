# FGG Mod for GCC
 - This is a model for the Wumble rumble pack, compatible with the FGG mod - that is, a detachable cable mod, using an FGG.0B connector from Adafruit.
If you want to make your own, you can get the connector and the plug from Adafruit:

 - This version of Wumble allows room for the connector, and moves the rumble motor slot to the right.
 - For a manual, you can refer to this guy's Imgur post about an aviator mod, which is very similar:
